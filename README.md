# Very Able

Now you'll be making many many variables. You will be so very able! (Sorry about that.)

### Guidelines

* You will be creating these variables in RunJS, evaluating the variables to show their values, and screen-shotting the final result.
* If another variable is mentioned in a task's description, that variable needs to appear in your code for that task to be marked correct. In other words, if `x` is `5` and you're asked to set `y` in terms of `x` so that it's twice `x`, the following code is correct:

```javascript
y = x * 2;
```

While the following code is not:


```javascript
y = 10;
```

This is because in the first example, if `x` changed value, `y` would continue to be twice `x`, but in the second example, `y` would always be `10`.


### Tasks

* Create a variable called myFirstName. Assign myFirstName a string value that represents your first name.
* Create a variable called myLastName. Assign myLastName a string value that represents your last name.
* Create a variable called myBestFriend. Assign myBestFriend a string value that represents your best friend name.
* Create a variable called mySentence. Assign mySentence a string that includes the variables from the previous three tasks.
* Create another variable called myFavoriteNum. Assign myFavoriteNum a number value that represents your favorite number!
* Create another variable called myMentalAge. Assign myMentalAge a number value that represents your mental age!
* Create another variable called myHeight. Assign myHeight a number value that represents your height in inches or centimeters!
* Create another variable called myFavoriteYear. Assign myFavoriteYear a number value that represents your favorite year!


### Tasks that use MATH

* Create another variable called mySum. Set it equal to the result of three plus one thousand nine hundred eighteen plus twenty-four plus one. Calculate it in code!
* Create another variable called myProduct. Set it equal to the result of  two hundred thirty-two times forty-three divided by two plus four (the operations should be written in that order!). Calculate it in code!
* Create another variable called heightAndAge. Set it equal to the sum of your mental age and height. Calculate it in code!
